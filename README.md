## Legal

This is *patented code*. All violations will be persecuted to the extent permitted by the law in a fast-lane Italian courtroom. You probably only have a generation or two to copy the code, fork it, modify it and/or sell it before you get sentenced to pay the full extent of the damage done to us by stealing our intellectual property. In fact, you shouldn't even be looking at this project. If you received this document in error, you're demanded to stop reading immediately. Do not distribute, mail or otherwise understand this document. All copies of this document must be destroyed, possibly by eating them.
